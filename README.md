# Cinema
Training project  
This project is an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats and see sales statistics.  

First, we create the cinema room with given parametrs.

Then, the menu should look like this:
1. Show the seats
2. Buy a ticket
3. Statistics
0. Exit
1. 
When the item Statistics is chosen, program should print the following information:

    The number of purchased tickets;
    The number of purchased tickets represented as a percentage. Percentages should be rounded to 2 decimal places;
    Current income;
    The total income that shows how much money the theatre will get if all the tickets are sold.
    
The item Buy a ticket shouldn't allow a user to buy a ticket that has already been purchased.
